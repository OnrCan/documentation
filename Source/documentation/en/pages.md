# Pages:

###### In this section, you can create any type of page and edit them whenever you want.

Specify a unique name for the page then choose a __Page Type__. Pyronome provides you any type of page you need. This option ease your workload. When you have a *Private Page*, you don't need to configure *Controller* if the user is logged in.

Assign the page as __Homepage__ with a click! Check the __Default Page__ box.

__Pyronome can__
- create your page's own __View__,
- place in __one or more view(s)__ to the page,
- redirect __to another page__ or __to an URL__.

Click on __SAVE PAGE__ button to create the page.
