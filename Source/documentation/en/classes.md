#### Class Name
  To find and modify the class you create in the classes list easily, you have to specify a unique name.

#### Class Collection Name
  Pyronome creates a container for each class you have. Thus, when you want to modify anything applied on all objects of a class, you just need to use its __Collection Name__.

#### Class Properties
  Pyronome makes responsive design possible for **admin panel**(değişecek). First, you will see that there are 3 types of device icons. You can specify the inputs looks for different screen resolution through them.

    !NOTE: There are 4 properties are given by default and you cannot make any change on them.

  While creating a new property, you will see that you can specify many attributes without coding a single line. Moreover, you can copy a property and use it in another project.
