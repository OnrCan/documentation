# Views:

Creating a new view with Pyronome is child's play. Just specify a unique name for your view and save it.

To add any block into the view, click __CREATE NEW VIEW BLOCK__ button then select a __Block Type__ according to your need.
Blocks are for including different view elements such as forms, header, footer, etc.

#### Including View Elements
- Including Views
    - Once you create a block, if you want to place in more than one view(s), you don't need to repeat yourself. Just mark __Insert View(s)__ radio and select the view(s) you want to insert to the block.

- Including Form
    - Form example, you started a project but your platform is being developed and you want to show a subscribe (or another type of) form for users to notify them when your system is ready. Consider it solved! After you select the __Insert Form__ radio, choose a template or create a new type of block in seconds.
